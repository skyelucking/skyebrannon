<p>      <font size="3" face="Helvetica">“Opening 
the paper-back sleeping pill I see.” It was my Mom’s playful comment 
as I splayed ‘Guns, Germs, and Steel’ (henceforth known as GGS) 
for my night-time reading ritual. She was visiting Samoa and had witnessed 
my journeys through the home-stretch of GGS, with their frequent ending 
dozes.  My page-turned-goal was fifteen, but eventually my cheek 
rested on the seventh, and my mom would rouse me,”Skye, you’re going 
to drool on the page, Sweetie. Light up one of those coils and turn 
out the light.” </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Helvetica">My 
friend Wikipedia told me that the author’s alternative title would 
be: &quot;A short history about everyone for the last 13,000 years&quot;. 
The playful (albeit trite, ask Hawkings and Bryson) title for an  
expansive subject in a slimlined text was a good and truthful one. 
Diamond reviews what factors led some civilizations to thrive while 
others fell subject to domination. He argues that these fates of societies 
were largely due, not to specific congnitive or racial factors but, 
opportunities the local lands and beasts provided. There are lots and 
lots of examples of how agriculture and the gregariousness of large 
animals lead societies toward their separate fates. </font></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Helvetica">Although, 
as I state above, the last few pages were a yawn-coaxing rehash, what 
they were rehashing, when served piping fresh, was extremely interesting. 
The 1998 Pulitzer Prize committee did well when they awarded Diamond 
their honor. The book is filled with examples that ellicit: “Makes 
sense,” and  “Huh, never thought that would make such a difference, 
but sure enough…,” and “Interesting.”  For example: wild stalks 
of wheat, back in the day, were programmed to shatter and spread their 
grain-seeds at the first opportinity. That’s the evolutionary agenda 
– to keep on keepin’ on. It was only the mutants that held onto 
their grains long enough for a hungry, bagel-crazed human to harvest 
and cultivate them for the future. Ironically it is the ‘evolutionary-smart’ 
wheat that is now sparse and the product of ‘evolutionary-dummies’ 
we’re spreading lox on today. Makes sense. We eat the mutants (and 
are still mutating away at them). Interesting. </font></p>

There are more volunteers than one could count on a single hand that 
have read GGS. The book strings together history, biology, agriculture, 
anthropology, genetics, psychology, geography and a few other sciences 
I’m cetain I’m slighting. With this grab-bag of sciences and the 
numerous examples in Diamond’s book, it is so very easy to relate 
or reference it in a many and wonderous conversation.  Yes, as 
I mentioned, the abundant examples do wear on you a bit at the end, 
but the book on the whole is worth it. My advice is to definitly read 
“Guns, Germs, and Steel” but, for the sake of dry pages, save its 
last chapter for the daytime.  </font></p>
